# Dead Developers Society 🌬️

The world is a poem written in code. We create emotional and romantic works using various languages like C, Java, and Swift. This repository is an open-source project that captures the soul of developers, telling our stories through code.

Inspired by Dead Poets Society, we aim to discover the hidden beauty in code and view the world from a new perspective, breaking free from the mundane. Each line of code becomes a verse, and each file becomes a poem. Let's write a new poem together. Carpe Diem! Seize the moment and let's complete our unique poem.

## Rules

### Brach Rule

> start with `language` and add `-`, finally add your github name. like `swift-moonkey48`. super easy!

### PR Rule

> I don't care commit conventions. It is not that important in this history. 
> One rule for PR is `use setted PR template`. 


### Thank you!

> Please express and share as much as possible that the developer is an emotional person. I look forward to your emotions expressed in various languages!
